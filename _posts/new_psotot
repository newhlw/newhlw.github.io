# ðŸŒŸ Understanding Neural Networks â€“ The Basics

Neural Networks are one of the core ideas behind **Deep Learning**. Inspired by the human brain, they are used to help computers learn from data.

## ðŸ§  What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is made up of **layers of neurons** (also called nodes). These neurons pass information to each other through **connections** (called weights).

A typical network has:
- **Input layer** â€“ takes in the data (like an image or number).
- **Hidden layers** â€“ where the learning happens.
- **Output layer** â€“ gives the final result (like a prediction).
